# cognito-integration-with-node


## What is AWS Cognito?
Amazon Cognito is an identity platform for web and mobile apps. Itâ€™s a user directory, an authentication server, and an authorization service for OAuth 2.0 access tokens and AWS credentials. With Amazon Cognito, you can authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Google and Facebook.

## User pools
An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito, or federate through a third-party IdP. Federated and local users have a user profile in your user pool.

## Identity pools
An identity pool is a collection of unique identifiers, or identities, that you assign to your users or guests and authorize to receive temporary AWS credentials. When you present proof of authentication to an identity pool in the form of the trusted claims from a SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or OAuth 2.0 social identity provider (IdP), you associate your user with an identity in the identity pool. The token that your identity pool creates for the identity can retrieve temporary session credentials from AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS).
